Hello everybody
I'm Fowluhh. Or you can call me Dawn!

I code in Web-based languages, Python, and sometimes Rust.
And i have very few braincells when it comes to CPP.

And i use VSCode. Its not very important but I thought it would be nice to add in.

And you can find me on Discord at FowluhhPPTX#5804.
